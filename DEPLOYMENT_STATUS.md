# 🚀 OfferHub Contract Deployment Status

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Contract Compilation Success**
All major contracts have been successfully compiled:
- ✅ User Registry Contract
- ✅ Fee Manager Contract  
- ✅ Publication Contract
- ✅ Rating Contract
- ✅ Reputation NFT Contract
- ✅ Escrow Contract
- ✅ Escrow Factory Contract
- ✅ Dispute Contract
- ✅ Emergency Contract

### 2. **React Hooks Created**
Complete set of React hooks for frontend integration:
- ✅ `useUserRegistry` - User verification and profile management
- ✅ `useEscrow` - Escrow transactions and milestone payments
- ✅ `usePublication` - Service and project publications
- ✅ `useRating` - User ratings and reviews
- ✅ `useDispute` - Dispute resolution and arbitration
- ✅ `useOfferHub` - Main hook combining all contract interactions
- ✅ TypeScript types for Soroban primitives

### 3. **Deployment Scripts**
- ✅ `deploy-all-contracts.sh` - Comprehensive deployment script
- ✅ `deploy-with-stellar.sh` - Stellar CLI compatible script
- ✅ `deploy-successful-contracts.sh` - Individual contract deployment

### 4. **Configuration Files**
- ✅ Environment variables template
- ✅ TypeScript constants file
- ✅ Contract addresses configuration

## ⚠️ Current Issue

### **WASM Compatibility Problem**
The contracts are compiled successfully but there's a compatibility issue when deploying:

```
Error: reference-types not enabled: zero byte expected
```

This is likely due to:
1. **SDK Version Mismatch**: Using `soroban-sdk = "23.0.0-rc.2.4"` (RC version)
2. **CLI Version**: Using `stellar 22.8.2` which may not be compatible with the RC SDK

## 🔧 Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Update to Stable SDK Version
```toml
# In Cargo.toml, change:
soroban-sdk = "23.0.0"  # Use stable version instead of RC
```

### Option 2: Use Compatible CLI Version
```bash
# Install the latest stable Soroban CLI
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
Deploy contracts individually using the Stellar CLI with proper identity setup.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix SDK Compatibility**: Update to stable SDK version
2. **Recompile Contracts**: Build with compatible version
3. **Deploy Contracts**: Use the deployment scripts
4. **Test Integration**: Verify hooks work with deployed contracts
5. **Frontend Integration**: Use the generated hooks in your React app

- `scripts/deploy-with-stellar.sh`
- `scripts/deploy-successful-contracts.sh`

### Documentation
- `CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Once the SDK compatibility issue is resolved, you can:

1. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-successful-contracts.sh
   ```

2. **Use the React hooks** in your frontend:
   ```typescript
   import { useOfferHub } from '@/hooks/contracts';
   
   const { userRegistry, escrow, publication, rating, dispute } = useOfferHub();
   ```

3. **Test contract interactions**:
   ```typescript
   // Example: Verify a user
   await userRegistry.verifyUser(userAddress, verificationLevel);
   
   // Example: Create an escrow
   await escrow.initializeEscrow(client, freelancer, amount);
   ```

## 💡 Recommendation

The most likely solution is to update the SDK to a stable version and recompile. The contracts are well-structured and the hooks are ready to use once deployed.

Would you like me to help you update the SDK version and retry the deployment?
