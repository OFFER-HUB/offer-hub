## Contract Integration

### 1. Rating Contract → Reputation Contract

The rating contract automatically triggers reputation updates:

```rust
// When user achieves rating milestones
pub fn update_reputation(env: Env, caller: Address, user: Address) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let stats = get_user_rating_stats(&env, &user)?;
    
    // Award achievement NFTs based on rating performance
    if stats.average_rating >= 480 && stats.total_ratings >= 20 {
        // Triggers reputation contract to mint top-rated NFT
        reputation_contract.mint_rating_achievement(
            &env, &caller, &user, 
            "top_rated_professional", 
            "4.8+ average with 20+ ratings"
        )?;
    }
}
```

### 2. New Reputation Contract Functions

Enhanced the reputation contract with rating-specific functions:

```rust
// New functions added to reputation-nft-contract
pub fn mint_rating_achievement(env, caller, to, achievement_type, rating_data) -> Result<(), Error>
pub fn get_user_achievements(env, user) -> Result<Vec<TokenId>, Error>
pub fn update_reputation_score(env, caller, user, rating_average, total_ratings) -> Result<(), Error>
```

## Achievement System

### Automatic NFT Minting

The system automatically mints achievement NFTs when users reach specific milestones:

| Achievement | Requirement | NFT Type |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| First Five Star | First 5-star rating | `first_five_star` |
| Ten Reviews | 10+ ratings received | `ten_ratings` |
| Top Rated Pro | 4.8+ avg, 20+ ratings | `top_rated_professional` |
| Consistency Award | Sustained high performance | `rating_consistency` |
| Most Improved | Significant improvement | `improvement_award` |

### Achievement Metadata

Each achievement NFT includes:
- **Name**: Human-readable achievement name
- **Description**: Achievement criteria and date earned
- **URI**: IPFS link to achievement artwork
- **Rarity**: Based on percentage of users who achieved it

## Rating-Based Privileges and Restrictions

## API Usage Examples

### Submit a Rating

```typescript
// Frontend integration example
const submitRating = async (
  raterAddress: string,
  ratedUserAddress: string,
  contractId: string,
  rating: number,
  feedback: string,
  category: string
) => {
  const result = await ratingContract.submit_rating({
    caller: raterAddress,
    rated_user: ratedUserAddress,
    contract_id: contractId,
    rating: rating,
    feedback: feedback,
    work_category: category
  });
  
  return result;
};
```

### Get User Rating Data

```typescript
const getUserRatingProfile = async (userAddress: string) => {
  const stats = await ratingContract.get_user_rating_stats({
    user: userAddress
  });
  
  const achievements = await reputationContract.get_user_achievements({
    user: userAddress
  });
  
  const privileges = await ratingContract.get_user_privileges({
    user: userAddress
  });
  
  return {
    stats,
    achievements,
    privileges
  };
};
```

### Check and Claim Incentives

```typescript
const claimAvailableIncentives = async (userAddress: string) => {
  const incentives = await ratingContract.check_rating_incentives({
    user: userAddress
  });
  
  for (const incentive of incentives) {
    await ratingContract.claim_incentive_reward({
      caller: userAddress,
      incentive_type: incentive
    });
  }
};
```

## Smart Contract Addresses

After deployment, update these addresses in your frontend configuration:

```typescript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  rating: "CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  reputation: "CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  userRegistry: "CXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
};
```

## Event Listening

Listen for contract events to update UI in real-time:

```typescript
// Listen for rating submissions
ratingContract.events.RatingSubmitted.subscribe((event) => {
  updateUserProfile(event.rated_user);
  refreshStatistics();
});

// Listen for achievement unlocks
reputationContract.events.AchievementMinted.subscribe((event) => {
  showAchievementNotification(event.to, event.nft_type);
});
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: All rating submissions require caller authentication
2. **Anti-Spam**: Rate limiting prevents abuse and manipulation
3. **Data Integrity**: Immutable rating records with event logging
4. **Moderation**: Community reporting with admin oversight
5. **Fair Play**: Prevents self-rating and duplicate submissions

## Testing Strategy

- Statistical calculations
- Privilege assignment logic
